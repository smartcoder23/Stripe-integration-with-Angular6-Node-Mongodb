# Stripe-integration-with-Angular6-Node-Mongodb

A simple integration of Stripe with angular,node and mongodb,
I am using "ngx-stripe" 

https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-stripe

Just clone my repo.

Then execute this steps
1. npm install(to install all the packages)

2.open terminal and hit command

ng serve 

3.open another terminal and hit command

nodemon app.js
or 
node app.js

In this project i am getting the user card info. and other details from the stripe response after user makes a payment and later on saved this details to the database.
